Collaborative Filtering Project

This project aims to implement collaborative filtering algorithms for recommendation systems using Python.
Collaborative filtering is a commonly used technique to generate personalized recommendations to users based on
their past behaviors and the behavior patterns of other users.

Project Goals

Implement collaborative filtering algorithms for recommending movies.
Evaluate the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms on MovieLens datasets.
Provide a platform for experimentation and analysis of recommendation systems.

Required Libraries

To run the project code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
Python 3.11.8
NumPy 1.26.4
Pandas 2.2.1
These libraries are used for data manipulation, computing similarities between users

Collaborative Filtering Project

This project aims to implement collaborative filtering algorithms for recommendation systems using Python. Collaborative filtering is a commonly used technique to generate personalized recommendations to users based on their past behaviors and the behavior patterns of other users.

Project Goals

Implement collaborative filtering algorithms for recommending articles, movies, music, or other items based on user ratings.
Evaluate the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms on real or synthetic datasets.
Provide a platform for experimentation and analysis of recommendation systems.
Required Libraries

To run the project code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
These libraries are used for data manipulation, computing similarities between users and items, and evaluating the performance of recommendation algorithms.

Code Structure

The project is organized into the following modules:

folder dataset: contains data in csv format
collaborative_filtering.py: Contains implementations of collaborative filtering algorithms(user-based collaborative filtering).
download_movielens.py:  Read the dataset and display the first few rows to understand it
