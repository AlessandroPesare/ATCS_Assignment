## Topics

1.Fairness in Group Recommendations

Summary of the course:  Recommender systems are commonly used in online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their past behavior. However, these systems can sometimes perpetuate bias and discrimination, resulting in unfair recommendations. Fairness in recommender systems aims to ensure that recommendations are based on merit rather than personal or social biases. The course will focus on current approaches to achieving fairness in recommender systems, including diverse representation, debiasing algorithms, and transparency in decision-making processes.  

-Recommender Systems 
-Collaborative Filtering 
-Group recommendations 
-Fairness in Group Recommendations 
-Fairness in Sequential Group Recommendations 

2.Data Centric AI for Health

Summary of the course: Starting from recent surveys that attempt to define "data-centric AI", in this course we will look at a few examples where data processing and modelling are interleaved in interesting ways. We will then address the problem of tracking the effects of data processing in detail, with the ultimate goal of extending explainability from model inference to the preparation of input datasets. As a practical application, will discuss scenarios where temporal series of medical care records are combined with representation learning to address interesting clinical research questions, from personalised risk prediction to patients stratification in the context of specific diseases.

-Overview of the notion of Data-Centric AI (DCAI)
-Real-world examples of complex DCAI processes
-Explainability of DCAI through data lineage
-Practical applications of DCAI

3.Active Metadata: How to get more value from Data Governance

Summary of the course: Companies with complex IT systems need processes and software to control and govern these systems.  Very often this work is perceived as nothing but a cost to the business.  We will explain why Data Governance is needed, and how it can be implemented. Then we will discuss how to exploit the metadata that has been gathered during a Data Governance initiative, changing the work from cost to something that can deliver more value.

4.Big Data Integration

Summary of the course: Data integration is the process of combining data residing in different sources and providing users with a unified view of them. This process appears with increasing frequency as the volume (that is, big data) and the need to share existing data explodes. It has become the focus of extensive theoretical work, and numerous open problems remain unsolved.  In this course, students will learn the main issues of big data integration and the current approaches toward its solution.

-An introduction to the problem of big data integration
-Record linkage
-Schema alignment
-Data fusion

5.Mining on Large Graphs

Summary of the course: Graphs are one of the most natural models of data and are ubiquitous across diverse applications. There has been substantial investigation of numerous mining problems and optimization problems involving graphs, ranging from classic shortest path and spanning tree problems to mining dense substructures, cohesive subgraphs, densest subgraphs, community detection and search, to study of information propagation and countering of harmful information campaigns. In this short course, students will learn the basic notions, techniques, and challenges in the context of these problems and their applications.

-Overview of Community detection and search.
-Overview of Motifs and cohesive subgraphs.
-Overview of Densest Subgraphs.
-Overview of Information Propagation Analysis in Networks.
